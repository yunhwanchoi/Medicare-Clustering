# K-Means Clustering on Medicare Data
The emergency department is chaotic in nature and requires a lot of resources, and therefore is
often expensive to manage. Therefore, understanding the pattern of spending in ED is crucial for
healthcare entities and systems to efficiently operate. The goal of this analysis is to generate
insights about spending patterns by Emergency Departments via segmenting lines of services
with similar characteristics into different groups by using K-means clustering.
